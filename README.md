# DDT

This is the unoffical website for the implementation of DDT (Deep Descriptor Transforming) and DDT+. 

Package Official Website: http://lamda.nju.edu.cn/code_DDT.ashx

This package is developed by Mr. Chen-Lin Zhang (http://lamda.nju.edu.cn/zhangcl/) and Mr. Xiu-Shen Wei (http://lamda.nju.edu.cn/weixs/). If you have any problem about 
the code, please feel free to contact Mr. Chen-Lin Zhang (zhangcl@lamda.nju.edu.cn). 
The package is free for academic usage. You can run it at your own risk. For other purposes, please contact Prof. Jianxin Wu (wujx2001@gmail.com).

## Requirements
The code needs Matconvnet(http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/).

A GPU is optional for faster speed.

## Demo
We include a subset of Object Discovery dataset(http://people.csail.mit.edu/mrub/ObjectDiscovery/) to provide an example.

First, you should change the location to your Matconvnet's location. Then change other options like gpu and pre-trained model's location.

Then you will get the results of DDT and DDT+, which include highlight regions, bounding boxes.
